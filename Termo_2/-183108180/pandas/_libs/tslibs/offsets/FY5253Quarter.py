class FY5253Quarter(FY5253Mixin):
    """
    DateOffset increments between business quarter dates for 52-53 week fiscal year.
    
        Also known as a 4-4-5 calendar.
    
        It is used by companies that desire that their

        - end on the last X day of the Y month.
        - end on the last X day closest to the last day of the Y month.
    
        X is a specific day of the week.
        Y is a certain month of the year
    
        startingMonth = 1 corresponds to dates like 1/31/2007, 4/30/2007, ...
        startingMonth = 2 corresponds to dates like 2/28/2007, 5/31/2007, ...
        startingMonth = 3 corresponds to dates like 3/30/2007, 6/29/2007, ...
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
        weekday : int {0, 1, ..., 6}, default 0
            A specific integer for the day of the week.
    
            - 0 is Monday
            - 1 is Tuesday
            - 2 is Wednesday

        startingMonth : int {1, 2, ..., 12}, default 1
            The month in which fiscal years end.
    
        qtr_with_extra_week : int {1, 2, 3, 4}, default 1
            The quarter number that has the leap or 14 week when needed.
    
        variation : str, default "nearest"
            Method of employing 4-4-5 calendar.
    
            There are two options:
    
            - "nearest" means year end is **weekday** closest to last day of month in year.
            - "last" means year end is final **weekday** of the final month in fiscal year.
    
        Examples
        --------
        >>> ts = pd.Timestamp(2022, 1, 1)
        >>> ts + pd.offsets.FY5253Quarter()
        Timestamp('2022-01-31 00:00:00')
